# V10 OAuth and OIDC

## V10.1 Generic OAuth and OIDC Security

### v5.0.0-10.1.1 (L2)

Verify that tokens are only sent to components that strictly need them. For example, when using a backend-for-frontend pattern for browser-based JavaScript applications, access and refresh tokens shall only be accessible for the backend.

### v5.0.0-10.1.2 (L2)

Verify that the client only accepts values from the authorization server (such as the authorization code or ID Token) if these values result from an authorization flow that was initiated by the same user agent session and transaction. This requires that client-generated secrets, such as the proof key for code exchange (PKCE) 'code_verifier', 'state' or OIDC 'nonce', are not guessable, are specific to the transaction, and are securely bound to both the client and the user agent session in which the transaction was started.


## V10.2 OAuth Client

### v5.0.0-10.2.1 (L2)

Verify that, if the code flow is used, the OAuth client has protection against browser-based request forgery attacks, commonly known as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which trigger token requests, either by using proof key for code exchange (PKCE) functionality or checking the 'state' parameter that was sent in the authorization request.

### v5.0.0-10.2.2 (L2)

Verify that, if the OAuth client can interact with more than one authorization server, it has a defense against mix-up attacks. For example, it could require that the authorization server return the 'iss' parameter value and validate it in the authorization response and the token response.



## V10.3 OAuth Resource Server

### v5.0.0-10.3.1 (L2)

Verify that the resource server only accepts access tokens that are intended for use with that service (audience). The audience may be included in a structured access token (such as the 'aud' claim in JWT), or it can be checked using the token introspection endpoint.

### v5.0.0-10.3.2 (L2)

Verify that the resource server enforces authorization decisions based on claims from the access token that define delegated authorization. If claims such as 'sub', 'scope', and 'authorization_details' are present, they must be part of the decision.

### v5.0.0-10.3.3 (L2)

Verify that if an access control decision requires identifying a unique user from an access token (JWT or related token introspection response), the resource server identifies the user from claims that cannot be reassigned to other users. Typically, it means using a combination of 'iss' and 'sub' claims.

### v5.0.0-10.3.4 (L2)

Verify that, if the resource server requires specific authentication strength, methods, or recentness, it verifies that the presented access token satisfies these constraints. For example, if present, using the OIDC 'acr', 'amr' and 'auth_time' claims respectively.



## V10.4 OAuth Authorization Server

### v5.0.0-10.4.1 (L1)

Verify that the authorization server validates redirect URIs based on a client-specific allowlist of pre-registered URIs using exact string comparison.

### v5.0.0-10.4.2 (L1)

Verify that, if the authorization server returns the authorization code in the authorization response, it can be used only once for a token request. For the second valid request with an authorization code that has already been used to issue an access token, the authorization server must reject a token request and revoke any issued tokens related to the authorization code.

### v5.0.0-10.4.3 (L1)

Verify that the authorization code is short-lived. The maximum lifetime can be up to 10 minutes for L1 and L2 applications and up to 1 minute for L3 applications.

### v5.0.0-10.4.4 (L1)

Verify that for a given client, the authorization server only allows the usage of grants that this client needs to use. Note that the grants 'token' (Implicit flow) and 'password' (Resource Owner Password Credentials flow) must no longer be used.

### v5.0.0-10.4.5 (L1)

Verify that the authorization server mitigates refresh token replay attacks for public clients, preferably using sender-constrained refresh tokens, i.e., Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) or Certificate-Bound Access Tokens using mutual TLS (mTLS). For L1 and L2 applications, refresh token rotation may be used. If refresh token rotation is used, the authorization server must invalidate the refresh token after usage, and revoke all refresh tokens for that authorization if an already used and invalidated refresh token is provided.

### v5.0.0-10.4.6 (L2)

Verify that, if the code grant is used, the authorization server mitigates authorization code interception attacks by requiring proof key for code exchange (PKCE). For authorization requests, the authorization server must require a valid 'code_challenge' value and must not accept a 'code_challenge_method' value of 'plain'. For a token request, it must require validation of the 'code_verifier' parameter.

### v5.0.0-10.4.7 (L2)

Verify that if the authorization server supports unauthenticated dynamic client registration, it mitigates the risk of malicious client applications. It must validate client metadata such as any registered URIs, ensure the user's consent, and warn the user before processing an authorization request with an untrusted client application.

### v5.0.0-10.4.8 (L2)

Verify that refresh tokens have an absolute expiration, including if sliding refresh token expiration is applied.

### v5.0.0-10.4.9 (L2)

Verify that refresh tokens and reference access tokens can be revoked by an authorized user using the authorization server user interface, to mitigate the risk of malicious clients or stolen tokens.

### v5.0.0-10.4.10 (L2)

Verify that confidential client is authenticated for client-to-authorized server backchannel requests such as token requests, pushed authorization requests (PAR), and token revocation requests.

### v5.0.0-10.4.11 (L2)

Verify that the authorization server configuration only assigns the required scopes to the OAuth client.



## V10.5 OIDC Client

### v5.0.0-10.5.1 (L2)

Verify that the client (as the relying party) mitigates ID Token replay attacks. For example, by ensuring that the 'nonce' claim in the ID Token matches the 'nonce' value sent in the authentication request to the OpenID Provider (in OAuth2 refereed to as the authorization request sent to the authorization server).

### v5.0.0-10.5.2 (L2)

Verify that the client uniquely identifies the user from ID Token claims, usually the 'sub' claim, which cannot be reassigned to other users (for the scope of an identity provider).

### v5.0.0-10.5.3 (L2)

Verify that the client rejects attempts by a malicious authorization server to impersonate another authorization server through authorization server metadata. The client must reject authorization server metadata if the issuer URL in the authorization server metadata does not exactly match the pre-configured issuer URL expected by the client.

### v5.0.0-10.5.4 (L2)

Verify that the client validates that the ID Token is intended to be used for that client (audience) by checking that the 'aud' claim from the token is equal to the 'client_id' value for the client.

### v5.0.0-10.5.5 (L2)

Verify that, when using OIDC back-channel logout, the relying party mitigates denial of service through forced logout and cross-JWT confusion in the logout flow. The client must verify that the logout token is correctly typed with a value of 'logout+jwt', contains the 'event' claim with the correct member name, and does not contain a 'nonce' claim. Note that it is also recommended to have a short expiration (e.g., 2 minutes).


## V10.6 OpenID Provider

### v5.0.0-10.6.1 (L2)

Verify that the OpenID Provider only allows values 'code', 'ciba', 'id_token', or 'id_token code' for response mode. Note that 'code' is preferred over 'id_token code' (the OIDC Hybrid flow), and 'token' (any Implicit flow) must not be used.

### v5.0.0-10.6.2 (L2)

Verify that the OpenID Provider mitigates denial of service through forced logout. By obtaining explicit confirmation from the end-user or, if present, validating parameters in the logout request (initiated by the relying party), such as the 'id_token_hint'.


## V10.7 Consent Management

### v5.0.0-10.7.1 (L2)

Verify that the authorization server ensures that the user consents to each authorization request. If the identity of the client cannot be assured, the authorization server must always explicitly prompt the user for consent.

### v5.0.0-10.7.2 (L2)

Verify that when the authorization server prompts for user consent, it presents sufficient and clear information about what is being consented to. When applicable, this should include the nature of the requested authorizations (typically based on scope, resource server, Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) authorization details), the identity of the authorized application, and the lifetime of these authorizations.

### v5.0.0-10.7.3 (L2)

Verify that the user can review, modify, and revoke consents which the user has granted through the authorization server.
